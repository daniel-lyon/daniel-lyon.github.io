I am currently an Astrophysics MPhil at [Queensland University of Technology](https://research.qut.edu.au/qutastrophysics/our-people/daniel-lyon/) (QUT) working with Dr Michael Cowley. I am interested in high-redshift galaxy evolution at cosmic dawn, infrared galaxies, black holes, AGN evolution, and the interstellar medium.

I obtained a B.Sc. degree in [Physics from QUT](https://www.qut.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-science-physics) with minors in Astrophysics and Computational Mathematics.

* From Nov-2023 to Feb-2024, I was a summer intern at [Swinburne University of Technology](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/)'s [Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/centres-groups-clinics/centre-for-astrophysics-supercomputing/). here I worked with the "Analysis of Galaxies at the Extremes" (AGATE) research group to study Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy (UDG) formation using the Keck telescopes. My role involved confirming globular cluster (GC) candidates through remote science observations with the Keck Telescopes. I successfully confirmed 7 GCs and discovered 2 black holes among the observed candidates.
* From Nov-2022 to Feb-2023, I was a summer research student at [Curtin University](https://www.curtin.edu.au/)'s node of [The International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research](https://www.icrar.org/) where I developed a novel method for measuring the redshift of high-redshift radio galaxies using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques to detect periodic signals from carbon monoxide (CO) emission lines. This method, named "zfinder," is available as an open-source Python package on [GitHub](https://github.com/daniel-lyon/zfinder) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/zfinder/).
* From Nov-2021 to Feb-2022, I was a research scholar at QUT where I performed a detailed statistical analysis of various AGN selection diagnostics to enhance the accuracy of identifying AGN and mitigating their contamination in astrophysical datasets.
