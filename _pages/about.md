# About

I am an Astrophysics MPhil at [Queensland University of Technology](https://research.qut.edu.au/qutastrophysics/our-people/daniel-lyon/) working with Dr Michael Cowley. I am interested in high-redshift galaxy evolution at cosmic dawn, infrared galaxies, AGN co-evolution, interstellar medium, and gas and dust.
