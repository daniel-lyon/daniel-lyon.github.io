I am currently studying my PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics at [Swinburne University of Technology](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/centres-groups-clinics/centre-for-astrophysics-supercomputing/) working with Professor Ivo Labbe. I am interested in high-redshift galaxy evolution at cosmic dawn, infrared galaxies, black holes, and AGN evolution, with a focus on the James Webb Space Telescope.

* I graduated my M.Phil in Astrophysics from [QUT](https://www.qut.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-science-physics) in July 2025

* I graduated my B.Sc. in Physics from [QUT](https://www.qut.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-science-physics) with minors in Astrophysics and Computational Mathematics in December 2022


* From Nov-2023 to Feb-2024, I was a summer intern at [Swinburne University of Technology](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/)'s [Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/centres-groups-clinics/centre-for-astrophysics-supercomputing/).
